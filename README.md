# Reading Time Tracking System

Reading Time Tracking System is an API-based application developed using Django Rest Framework (DRF). 
It allows users to track the time they spend reading books. Users can start and end reading sessions, 
and the system saves the duration of each session as well as the total reading time for each book. 
The system also provides statistics for users, including total reading time over the last 7 and 30 days.
